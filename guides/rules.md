# Pops' Rules for Blades

**Rule #1**: get the best gear you can get "right now"

This means, if you're wondering if you should "myth" something, ask yourself "is it better than what I have?" If so, myth it. If not, scrap it.

**Rule #2**: known quantities are always better than hoping Lond and Severio will come through for you

If you can find gear in a drop or in the sigil store that tells you exactly what primary and secondary enchants you'll get and if you like them, get them. Even the "double assured" sigli store weapons get junked by Severio and his pal.

**Rule #3**: as soon as you start feeling good about how you’re playing, you will be punished severely.

Blades seems to know when you're doing well or having a good day, then suddenly your "last big crit" will do no damage, or your weapon will wave all over the screen like it has a mind of its own, or you'll see 400 ping... If you're on a big winning streak, be ready for Blades to bring you back down to Earth.

**Rule #4**: the closer you get to a milestone, the more likely you’ll match someone who kicks your ass down 75 trophies. And just for fun, you’ll get that same person 3-4 more times in a row.

This is the most soul crushing rule of all. Let's say you're approaching 2500 (Imperial Arena), the chances that you'll breeze right through are *very* low. Instead, you'll creep up to 2490 and lose and lose and lose and end up at 2400. And that's if you're lucky. If you're normal (like me), you'll get pushed all the way down to 2300. You'll get back up to 2490 and repeat the process. This is the trauma of Rule 4.

**Rule #5**: don't stress out about Blades because Bethesda sure doesn't

Bethesda produced an amazing game in Blades, but they seem to be done with it. They give us new weapon skins from time to time, new sigil events, etc., but they really don't invest much in the Arena anymore. Therefore, don't wind yourself up about it because things aren't likely to get better.

**Rule #6**: blades knows when you are saving up for an artifact, so the more excited you get about finding an artifact in a chest the more likely you'll get lumber

Blades **loves** lumber and assumes you do too. You have a level 10 town with all shops at level 10? Too bad, you'll get lots and lots of lumber. You really, really need Warlock's Ring right? Nah, lumber for you.

**Rule #7**: When shopping in guildie towns, the vendors figure out what mats you’re shopping for and make them as scarce as offensive spells in Pops’ arsenal. You’ll get plenty of what you’re not looking for though.

Jornibret Falcon says this doesn't happen to her, but it sure happens to Pops. If I start buying up Deathbell, for example, literally *none* of the vendors will have it. Next day when I go searching for Frost Salts... nothing but Death Bell.

**Rule #8**: blades will randomly and inexplicably deny you wins by any means possible at any time and for any reason.
