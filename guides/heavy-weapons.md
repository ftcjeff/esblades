# Pops' Beginner's Guide to Heavy Weapons

Heavy Weapons Fighting (HWF) is just whack whack whack and call it a day, right? Wrong! There are a lot of decisions to be made that make a huge difference in how you'll play and what types of foes will give you the most trouble. As you read through this guide, remember that these are just my opinions after driving Pops and Moms Barbarians for a few seasons. Other HWFs will have different ideas and many will have *better* ideas... so take this all with a grain of salt and consider this a beginner's guide to "2H" or more accurately Heavy Weapons fighting.

First, the two foes that give me the most trouble are Mages and Versatile Weapons Fighters (VWF) who like to hide behind their shield and spam spells and strikes. When fighting another HWF, it becomes a battle of who can crit more and who stuns. These fights are generally over in a matter of seconds so getting into a debate about casting times and resist durations is useless. Mages give me trouble because the biggest enemy of HWF is stunning (or getting incapacitated). Therefore, with Mages, Ice Spikes, Wall of Fire, and Paralyze are the things to watch out for because they're the things that will keep you from fighting... and as a HWF that's all you've got. With VWF who like to hide behind their shields, the issue is hitting into their high block. They gleefully come out to play after that while you're standing there like an idiot. As you consider the rest of this guide, keep this in mind.

## Under Level 50?

You can start getting artifacts at level 45, but in order to use what are called "end game" weapons and armor, you need to be level 50 or higher. This is when Blades starts getting interesting. Until then, do all the quests, grind in the Abyss, and starting figuring out how to fight in the Arena. **Do not** get worked up when you're in the arena. 

Learn what works for you and learn what other people are doing. Blades matches you according to your *trophy* count, so it's very likely that even though you're level 15 (for example), you could easily get matched against someone level 96. You'll have **zero** chance against them, but see what their gear looks like. How do they fight? What spells do they cast? Do they block? Sometimes higher level players will let you win a round (and this can take a while as you chip away at their end game gear), sometimes they finish you off quickly. Either way, *do not* concede and *do not* disconnect. Just play it out and learn something.

As far as weapons and armor go under level 50, don't worry about it. Craft the best gear that your Blacksmiths will make for you. *If* you decide to temper it, don't temper it beyond Flawless (otherwise you're wasting materials). You should enchant all your gear so that you can be prepared for how awful Severio is at his job. He never gets better... so get used to it.

You can read on in this guide, but until you're at level 50 none of this really matters.

## Skill Tree

For help building your skill tree and planning it out, see the ES Blades [Skill Tree Calculator](https://esblades.net/skill-tree).

My current split is 350 magicka / 540 stamina, and I think that's been working okay. I just spent a month at 200 / 690 and that was a looooong season of not being able to hit Ward. If you go lower than 350 magicka, you may want to boost that with enchants.

You don't really want to ask me about spells as a HWF, I stink at them. I tend to go all defensive spells (if I'm able to get them cast at all) and go with Resist Elements (RE) at level 3, Ward at level 3, and Absorb at level 3. That's literally all I have unlocked. Talk to @ghostwill2 if you want to learn how to cast spells at a HWF.

For Perks, I have them set as follows:

|Perk|Level|
|---|:---:|
|Elemental Protection|1|
|Augmented Flames|6|
|Willpower|5|
|Augmented Frost|4|
|Augmented Shock|2|
|Load Bearer|8|
|Matching Set|4|
|Enchantment Synergy|2|
|Armsman|1|
|Barbarian|6|
|Advanced Tempering|3|
|Scout|1|
|Combat Focus|5|
|Augmented Poison|4|
|Healing Surge|3|
|Mettle|1|

For skills, I use 3 things: Piercing Strikes (PS), Quick Strikes (QS), and Recovery Strikes (RS). They are called "double taps" because you tap once and get a couple swings out of it, and the swings deal elemental damage or ravage even if hitting into a high block. The are also stun-proof, meaning if you QS into a high block, you will not get stunned. RS is a must-have because it breaks *your* stuns, so you should always have this unlocked and equipped.

Some HWF also go with dodges because they also break stuns, but I find dodges to be waaaaay too slow. Dodges are cool because if you time them right, you can also avoid ice spikes and paralyze. I've never been good at that, so double-taps for me. It's important to keep *all* of these at skill level 1. **Do not** boost these, because the added stamina requirements for the higher levels don't justify the small difference in damage. Keep them at 1 so that you can hit them more often (because at level 1 they have lower stam requirements). Note that GuardBreaker (GB) can also be handy to deal with those VWF who like to hide behind shields. Note that I set GB to 3 because if I ever use it, I want it to stun the opponent longer.

Here's how I have my skills:

|Skill|Level|
|---|:---:|
|Quick Strikes|1|
|Piercing Strikes|1|
|Venom Strikes|1|
|Recovery Strikes|1|
|Power Attack|1|
|Skullcrusher|1|
|Guardbreaker|3|

## Weapons

Your best friend here are the sigil store weapons. Get them in this order:

|Sigil Weapon|Specs|
|---|---|
|SunderBlade|181 damage vs. blocking targets, ravages stamina|
|SpiderFang|79 poison damange, ravages stamina, ravages magicka|
|Maul of the Aureal|79 fire damage, ravages magicka|
|BreathTaker|157 damage vs. blocking targets, ravages magicka, ravages stamina|

Some people say the Maul isn't useful unless you're fighting mages, but I have good success with it and I catch a lot of people on fire.

After this, you'll need frost and shock weps. Doesn't matter if you get Dragonbone (DB) or Divine Sigil Weps. I've also been experimenting with weps that don't ravage and I'm finding that I like them. My current weapons are:

|Crafted Weapon|Specs|
|---|---|
|DB Warhammer of Winter|67 frost damage, ravages stamina|
|DB Battleaxe of Storms|77 shock damage, shock 15 points more effective at Draining|

As much as I'm not supposed to, I am really warming up to this shock axe. I like it so much, I've started trying to roll the a Warhammer of Winter that has a 15% bonus + more effective at Freezing and see how that goes.

The reason I like these is I've gone PDOC, so the quicker I can condition people the more damage I can do. If you go the PDIA route, then you should definitely focus on ravage weps.

## Armor

### Selecting Armor

The first decision when it comes to armor is Plate or Mail? This will affect the fighter you become as well as what additional gear to grind for. Pops started with Plate and the big advantage here is Armor Rating (AR). With Plate armor, you can become a "turtle" and substain quite a lot of physical damage. Remembering that Mages and VWF who hide a lot are our worst foes, AR doesn't matter a lot here. AR matters a lot when you're fighting another HWF, but even then if you can out-crit and/or stun them, you'll win that battle even if you're standing in your skivvies.

Mail armor has the advantage that you get 2 free resists. The resist chart is as follows:

|Mail Material|Physical Resist|Elemental Resist|
|---|:---:|:---:|
|Dragon Scale|Cleaving|Poison|
|Daedric|Slashing|Fire|
|Stalhrim|Bashing|Frost|
|Glass||Shock|

These resists come at a reduction in AR which makes you slightly "squishy". Considering who our worse foes are, however, you can see that these start providing more protection than just raw AR and I've become a strong believer that this is a good thing. If you choose to go the Plate route, that's perfectly fine and as I said previously, Pops started there and did well with it. If you choose to go Mail, then start with Dragon Scale because it's a lot easier to obtain. Daedric, Stalhrim, and Glass you'll need to get from the Sigil Store as "Divine" and then hope you get good enchants with them (and you won't). So, start with Dragon Scale which you can get from your Smithy.

If you work your way up the leaderboard and make it to IA, you'll end up with a full set of _Blades_ Armor. This is pretty cool armor and I've heard it has some advantages (although I don't know what they are). They don't match with Dragon Plate or Dragon Scale, so if you're interested in enchanting them to see what you get, keep that in mind.

### Enchanting Armor

How do you enchant your armor? Your chest piece, helmet and boots should all be enchanted with _Peerless Health_. Since health obtains a 3x multiplier in the Arena, it only makes sense to take advantage of that. That said, if you're fighting a pesky mage, you might want to have a bunch of elemental resists boots and helmets laying around. Pesky mages don't do a lot of physical damage, but they do hella elemental damage (including ice spikes and paralyze), so if you can negate that it's better than having the extra health.

Peerless Health isn't enough for your chest piece. You must _also_ get Spell Resist (SR) as a "secondary". If you can get SR and literally _anything else_ that's even better. The "perfect" chest piece would be SR and Shorten Condition. However, anything with SR you can myth.

### Gloves

Enchant your gloves with Subsuming Stamina and you're looking for either max 126+ PDIA **or** 26+ PDOC depending on your PDIA vs. PDOC decision above. You want to stay consistent because it will stack. The reason you want to start with Subsuming is because you can use it in *all* of your loadouts.

Next, start working on your elemental gloves. You'll want level 10 enchants regardless, but work on either PDIA or PDOC (whichever you chose for your armor). As you try the enchants (it takes a while), rotate through the elements because it's easier to farm the materials rotationally rather than, for example, just going for a fire ring.

Once you have all of your gloves crafted, _then_ you can start looking for the unicorn PDIA+PDOC combos.

### Rings

#### Warlock's Ring

As a HWF, you want Warlock's Ring (WR) because it gives you 24% attack speed boost (meaning you can typically get 2 crits in when your opponent stuns instead of just 1) and it gives you 24-29 points of retal against every element (24 vs. frost and shock and 29 vs. fire and poison). This is a legendary artifact, so you can only get it in a Gold, Elder, or Legendary chest. You might get it quickly, you might never get it. When you do, celebrate and then head over to Staki and practice crits with your new attack speed. I practiced 30-60 minutes a day for about 2 weeks before I really got the hang of it. Don't feel stupid working with Staki - it's worth it.

#### Ring Continued

Warlock's Ring is interesting because it has a *lot* of advantages, but it comes at a price. The price is the chance to add one more 1x to your stacked enchantment for Enchantment Synergy (ES). This is significant. Of my two toons, Moms is *much* stronger than Pops because she has stacked elemental rings (because she does not have WR). While I can usually get Moms into the top 75, it's really hard getting her much higher. She has other problems with her build, but the lack of speed is certainly one of them.

Therefore, if you choose to use WR, you'll want 1 of the rings described next. If you do not have WR, you'll want 2 of them.

The next thing to realize is that the primary rings boost for HWF are basically useless. You don't want any of your "skills" boosted (because it'll cost more stam for not enough benefit) and you probably don't have any of the spells unlocked anyway. Therefore, craft whatever rings you want. In other words, you don't need to craft Ebony Faerite rings that take 12h... just craft or buy anything.

First, enchant your rings with Subsuming Stamina and you're looking for either max 126+ PDIA **or** 26+ PDOC. If you get both, I'll submit to your awesomeness. However, depending on your PDIA vs. PDOC decision above, that's what you're looking for here because it will stack. The reason you want to start with Subsuming is because you can use it in *all* of your loadouts.

Next, start working on your elemental rings. You'll want level 10 enchants regardless, but work on either PDIA or PDOC (whichever you chose for your armor). As you try the enchants (it takes a while), rotate through the elements because it's easier to farm the materials rotationally rather than, for example, just going for a fire ring.

Once you have all of your rings crafted, _then_ you can start looking for the unicorn PDIA+PDOC combos.

### Necklaces

Necklaces are a _giant_ pain in the butt. You know how crappy of a job Lond does crafting necklaces? He almost never gives you the primary boosts you want. You know how crappy of a job Severio does enchanting literally anything? Now, put those together... the odds of getting Lond to make the necklace you want and then having Severio give you the secondaries you want are amazingly low. Regardless, you'll get *something* and that's better than nothing.

So what do you want? As a HWF, you want the following primary boosts (in order):

* +5 Enchantment Synergy (ES)
* +5 Matching Set (MS)
* +5 Barbarian
* +5 Augmented [frost, shock, fire, frost] Ranks

If you don't have +4 or +5 ES, the necklace is junk and should be scrapped. To be super clear, without ES the necklace is useless to you.

Assuming Lond ever gives you something useful (and he will), you take it over to Severio and what do you want from him? It's best to craft "retal" necklaces. If I were doing it over again, I'd do them in this order:

* Frost Retal
* Poison Retal
* Shock Retal
* Fire Retal

Then, the secondary bonuses you'll want are any combination of:

* Shorten Stun 20%
* PDIA
* PDOC

Again, PDIA or PDOC depending on your armor and both is a unicorn.
